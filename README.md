ActiveDirectoryOAuthApp
=======================
This project is one example and can use as start point for develop Restful API. 
My idea is to pack some features needed for my future development and share these ideas with you
##Features##
* Web Api REST
* Entity Framework repository
* IoC and DI with AutoFac
* Some kind of OAuth with Active Directory integration
* Mapping of entities with AutoMapper
